# Code-Refactor-Challenge

Client is requesting that their existing webpage follows accessability standars and is optimized for search engines. 

These are the acceptance criteria:
* webpage meets accessability standars
* semantic HTML ELEMENTS present
* elements have logical structure 
* image elements are viewable 
* accessible alt attributes present
* heading attributes are in sequential order
* title element has a concise, descriptive title

The existing code needed semantic elements, accessability changes to add alt text to all images, reorganized headings in sequential order, and working links.
